pipe - We use the term pipe to mean connecting a data flow from one process to another. Generally you
attach, or pipe, the output of one process to the input of another.



popen - 

The popen function allows a program to invoke another program as a new process and either pass data
to it or receive data from it. 
The command string is the name of the program to run, together with any
parameters. open_mode must be either “r” or “w”.

#include <stdio.h>
FILE *popen(const char *command, const char *open_mode);
int pclose(FILE *stream_to_close);

If the open_mode is “r”, output from the invoked program is made available to the invoking program
and can be read from the file stream FILE * returned by popen, using the usual stdio library functions
for reading (for example, fread). However, if open_mode is “w”, the program can send data to the
invoked command with calls to fwrite. The invoked program can then read the data on its standard
input. Normally, the program being invoked won’t be aware that it’s reading data from another process;
it simply reads its standard input stream and acts on it.

A call to popen must specify either “r” or “w”; no other option is supported in a standard implementation
of popen. This means that you can’t invoke another program and both read from and write to it. On
failure, popen returns a null pointer. If you want bidirectional communication using pipes, the normal
solution is to use two pipes, one for data flow in each direction.

pclose- 

When the process started with popen has finished, you can close the file stream associated with it using
pclose. The pclose call will return only when the process started with popen finishes. If it’s still running
when pclose is called, the pclose call will wait for the process to finish.
The pclose call normally returns the exit code of the process whose file stream it is closing. If the invoking
process has already executed a wait statement before calling pclose, the exit status will be lost because
the invoked process has finished and pclose will return –1, with errno set to ECHILD.
